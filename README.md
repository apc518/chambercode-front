## Featured Apps
### Flippr üéπ
A simple, clean web-app version of the first program I ever wrote, used for music theory tinkering.

### Spookr üéÉ
Spookr is a spooky music generator. Perfect for halloween time!

### Context Collapse üéÆ
A 2D shooter game where you are a cat in space shooting minecraft arrows.
Context Collapse has a live leaderboard that you can submit your highscores to. Can you beat mine?

### Matheroids üå†
Matheroids is a math game was developed as part of a school project in early 2020. It was made in collaboration with Jack Bodine, Kate Schuh, Lucas Leary, and Rachel Johnson of the University of Puget Sound

### LaTeX Matrix Generator ‚úíÔ∏è
A simple but helpful tool for getting the LaTeX code for a given matrix. Taking linear algebra I found this to be tedious, so I made a slick UI with a live preview powered by MathJax, with input controls almost identical to Google Sheets/Excel.

## Technologies 
ChamberCode is a full-stack many-page website built on the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
I use several libraries in addition to MERN such as SweetAlert2, Material-UI and p5.js.

[JavaScript Mastery](https://javascriptmastery.eo.page/)'s [MERN Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngc9gnGgUdA) is where the project started in the first place. At that time, I didn't even have a portfolio/app-hub in mind, I just wanted to learn React. This one also has a companion [github](https://github.com/adrianhajdin/project_mern_memories)
