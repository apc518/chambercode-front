### LaTeX Matrix Generator
A simple but helpful tool for getting the LaTeX code for a given matrix. Taking linear algebra I found this to be tedious, so I made a slick UI with a live preview powered by MathJax, with input controls almost identical to Google Sheets/Excel.

## Technologies 
ChamberCode is a full-stack many-page website built on the MERN stack: MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.
I use several libraries in addition to MERN such as SweetAlert2, Material-UI and p5.js.
